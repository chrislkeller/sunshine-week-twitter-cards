Sunshine Week Twitter Cards

[Sunshine Week](https://www.spj.org/sunshineweek.asp) is a weeklong effort to help the public understand why open government matters, and to advocate — as journalists — for strong open meeting and open records laws.

In honor Sunshine Week 2021, I made these shareable social media cards with tips you can use before and after requesting public records.
